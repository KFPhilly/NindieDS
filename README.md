# NindieDS
This NDS emulator is currently in a very early stage and is not able
to emulate anything. Though it already showed first life signs correctly
emulating parts of the NDS7 binary of a commercial title. The ARM emulator 
core is based on my very experimental and highly unstable GBA emulator 
which is written in C++ in contrary to NindieDS. Switching to C was mainly
for personal but also for performance reasons.

If like this project and would like to contribute to it don't hestitate 
to do so. Pull requests are very welcome. Though I cannot guarantee that 
I'll always handle them correctly since I have little experience with
multiple people working on a GIT repo. Also if you'd like to talk about
NDS emulation or emulation in general feel free to to write me a email
to dangerthefuture@gmail.com.
